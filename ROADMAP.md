# Development roadmap

This is the proposed sequence for implementing the product in [project_description.md](project_description.md). Current execution belongs in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md), not in a second independent set of status cells here. Each phase has a coherent outcome and acceptance obligations; each may require several bounded coding-pipeline runs.

**Reconciliation requirement:** this starter kit was prepared from the conversation and the supplied coding-pipeline repository, not from the unavailable full local specification file. D00 must map the exact existing file before implementation. Phase labels below are development labels, not claimed verbatim replacements for any milestones in that file.

| Phase | Outcome | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [D00](development/phases/D00-specification-and-operating-readiness.md) | Specification and operating readiness | Initial repository |
| [D01](development/phases/D01-testable-product-foundation.md) | Testable product foundation | D00 |
| [D02](development/phases/D02-durable-scientific-records-and-provenance.md) | Durable scientific records and provenance | D01 |
| [D03](development/phases/D03-seeded-project-intake-and-navigable-vault.md) | Seeded project intake and navigable vault | D02 |
| [D04](development/phases/D04-controlled-execution-and-recovery.md) | Controlled execution and recovery | D02, D03 |
| [D05](development/phases/D05-tool-contracts-and-capability-execution.md) | Tool contracts and capability execution | D04 |
| [D06](development/phases/D06-single-researcher-vertical-slice.md) | Single-researcher vertical slice | D03, D04, D05 |
| [D07](development/phases/D07-independent-verification-and-scoped-acceptance.md) | Independent verification and scoped acceptance | D06 |
| [D08](development/phases/D08-adaptive-research-coordination.md) | Adaptive research coordination | D07 |
| [D09](development/phases/D09-whole-project-operation-and-reporting.md) | Whole-project operation and reporting | D08 |
| [D10](development/phases/D10-scientific-pilot-and-architecture-evaluation.md) | Scientific pilot and architecture evaluation | D09 |

## Scope discipline

The sequence deliberately establishes a usable single-researcher path before multi-agent coordination. Reliability, provenance, boundaries, and recovery are developed with each capability, not appended as a final hardening phase. Verification infrastructure for development begins at D01; scientific candidate verification is the product feature delivered at D07.

The phases are proposed defaults. Move an outcome if the exact specification or actual interfaces require it, and record why. Distributed services, a graph database, an Obsidian plugin, and any particular symbolic/numerical/coding tool are not prerequisites unless the specification explicitly requires them. Future plans remain outcome-level until they become executable requests.

## The first implementation boundary

D00 prepares and verifies the environment. D01 is one complete, testable foundation slice; it must not be split into an accepted empty skeleton followed later by tests. Start with one CWI milestone because the frozen bootstrap candidate check requires the whole foundation. Later runs can use more internal milestones when each intermediate candidate satisfies the frozen checks.

## Requirement coverage

Use [REQUIREMENTS.md](development/REQUIREMENTS.md) to map each mandatory requirement to a phase, request, exact evidence, and integrated source. Record deferred obligations in [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) with authorization and resume conditions. A phase cannot be called complete while its mandatory obligations are merely moved into an unowned future list.

## Progression under continuous authorization

After commissioning and the actual activation grant, normal completion of a request or phase leads directly to the next ready scoped request. Do not wait for a human merely to move from D02 to D03. Every transition still requires its dependency and evidence gates. Use [AUTONOMY.md](development/AUTONOMY.md) and [AUTHORIZATION.md](development/AUTHORIZATION.md).

D10 requires actual scientific evaluation and any mandated human judgment; it is not automatically completed by implementing the evaluation code. A blocked mandatory requirement remains visible even when other independent development can continue.
